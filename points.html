        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Ranks and Points system in this game is fairly simple. To rank up you just need to keep the reactor and the turbines connected to the grid and meet demand. At the end of your shift (At 00:00) you will earn a paycheck. Each time you get your paycheck your 'Money' turns into points. In other words your main priority is to sell as much power as possible.</p>

        <p style="color: #4ed171;">Bonus: 0%</p><br>
        <p>You've got the hang of this facility. usually more reliable than your visitors Trainees can assist around the nuclear powerplant! They can assist Jr. Operators and Sr. Operators on some menial tasks. Yet they usually aren't skilled enough to maintain a nuclear reactor solo. You can somewhat rely on them for a while before you need to intervene to stop a reactor going in a meltdown.</p>

        <p style="color: #4ed171;">Bonus: 10%</p><br>
        <p>Skilled personnel. Can handle most of the emergencies with ease. Yet they can't remain calm when a visitor presses 'SCRAM' and now they need to re-do the whole reactor start up sequence... Again.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Considered 'One of the best.' Minimal errors, deal with emergencies, keep the plant running at 100% efficiency. There won't be anyone else like them who can handle the powerplant as good as them. You can rely onto them for anything and everything.</p>

        <p>You've reached it! The Supervisor title! You should be proud of yourself. That is no small feat! You can finally oversee those who are below you! Just be prepared for chaos and prepare to discipline trainees. Good luck!</p>

        <p>At this point all nuclear reactors are too easy for you. Emergencies? You've gotten used to them. Critical failures? Can fix them in your sleep. You probably aren't even in the plant at all. Probably at some other place managing shifts... Right?</p>
