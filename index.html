        <h2>Removal Of Explosion</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone,</p>
        <br>
        <p>I bring unfortunate news, however, due to recent Roblox moderation changes regarding real-world tragedies, and due to Nediah's Halska unfortunate removal. I'll be making some adjustments to ensure the game stays within platform guidelines until further notice.</p>
        <br><p>Starting today, the reactor explosion event will be temporarily removed from the game. This change is being made to avoid any risk of removal or moderation action due to its undeniable relation with the Chernobyl disaster.</p>
        <br><p>The rest of the game will remain playable as usual, and this decision is purely to keep the experience available for everyone. We'll be working on how to reintroduce it in a way that fits Roblox's updated rules.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thanks for your understanding and continued support. ðŸ§¡</p>

      <h2>Welcome to the Team</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the team, your first shift starts tomorrow morning! We're short-staffed, but I'm sure you and your big brain can figure it out!</p>
      <p>Be responsible for overseeing a multi-billion-dollar operation, one of the planet's most potent and delicate energy systems. Every decision matters, from regulating the reactor's behaviour, running turbines, managing cooling systems, maintaining pumps and valves, to responding to emergencies, all while maintaining strict safety protocols.</p>
      <p>At Koyot Digital, we simulate a hypothetical Western RBMK-1500 reactor. The game strikes a balance between realism and accessibility. Meet demand, and enjoy your nuclear operator journey!</p>
      <p><em>We hope to see you in the game very soon!</em></p>
