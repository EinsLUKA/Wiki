The main display shows how many rods have been removed and by how much, while the heat distribution display shows how hot each sector of the reactor is. The <a class="g">modes</a> represent what stage of operation the reactor is in: Shutdown (0), Startup (1), Operating (2). The <a class="gr"> Offline Core Cooling</a> along with the shutdown control rods keep the reactor cold while not in operation. In the event of high reactor water, the recirc drains can be used to dump out the excess water. In the event of an emergency, the <a class="r">АЗ-5</a> can be utilized to quickly insert the rods back into the reactor. If you are feeling brave however, you can turn off the automatic АЗ-5.

      <h2>Turbines</h2>
      <div class="location-content">
        <img src="images/Turbine_Panel.webp" alt="Rod Control Panel" class="enlargeable"/>
        <div>
          <p>The turbines generate power, which makes you money (peak). Steam makes its way from the steam drums, and into the turbines, spinning the turbine blades. Before making money however, you must sync to the grid, and to do that, you must get the speed near 1800 <a class="b">RPM</a></p>
          <p>In order to start the turbines, first of all, you must disengage turning gear, by calling engineering. Before starting, you should enable the <a class="gy">synchroscope</a>, and open the lid to the sync button. After this, you may start opening the <a class="g">turbine valve</a>, which lets steam into the turbine, spinning it. During this, you may follow the <a class="o">flow gauge</a>, which tells you how close you are to reaching 1800 RPM; Higher than 0 means you will overshoot, lower means you will undershoot. It is suggested you overshoot before you get near 1800 since the ascent is quite slow.</p>
          <p>If the <a class="o">pressure</a> is too high, consider opening the <a class="y"> bypass valve</a>. It vents steam into the condenser, skipping the turbines entirely.</p>
          <p>Once you get close to 1800 RPM, watch the synchroscope; You will be able to successfully sync by pressing the sync button once the needle reaches the top (watch the green light). A range of 1785-1815 RPM is recommended, unless you have a quick reaction time. A sync should be followed by a quick rise in the turbine valve, to prevent a trip due to reverse power, after that, raise it to 100% and close bypass (beware of <a class="b">vibration</a>). If you failed to sync, wait until the turbine drops below 600 RPM, and then try again.</p>
          <p>The <a class="gr">bleed valve</a> is used to share steam between the 2 loops, however contradictory to the guide; it is not recommended you use it while syncing turbine B, as it can lead to both turbines tripping.</p>
          <p>After going online, you should utilize the <a class="y">automatic bypass</a> to hold the <a class="b">demand</a>; Divide the demand by 2 and insert it into both keypads.</p>
          <p>Load rejection can occur if there is a sudden drop in power usage (demand). It is mainly an issue before going online, when too many pumps are turned off at once.</p>
          <p>The proper way to shut down the turbines is to lower power, desync the turbine (via the electrical panel, with the generator breakers), lower the RPM and open the bypass.</p>
          <p>The option to <a class="r">manually trip</a> the turbines is also there, usually used at reactor shutdown.</p>

        <div>
          <p>The <a class="g">condenser coolant pumps</a> control the rate at which steam can condense back into condensate (water recovered from the condenser). Each condenser has its own loop, <a class="r">loop A</a> and <a class="y">loop B</a>. A coolant is pumped through the condenser to cool the steam back into water; this heat is then transported to a cooling tower, where it can be cooled to remain effective.</p>
          <p>High <a class="o">condenser coolant temperature</a> is caused by an insufficient number of pumps and can lead to high outlet pressure in the turbines, followed by vibration and if left unchecked, tripping the turbine; However, an abundance of pumps can hinder efficiency, resulting in less points being earned.</p>

      <h2>Condensate, Hotwell and Water system</h2>
      <div class="location-content">
        <img src="images/Condensate, Hotwell, Water System Panel.webp" alt="Rod Control Panel" class="enlargeable"/>
        <div>
          <p>The <a class="g">condensate pumps </a>move water from the hotwell to the deaerator, controlling the deaerator level. The hotwell collects the water (condensate) from the condenser, which is located below it. To prevent the deaerator from being overfilled, the overflow valve (located on the deaerator panel) should be on at all times.</p>
          <p>Similarly to the feedwater pumps, the condensate pumps can also cavitate and trip; This is caused by a low <a class="b">hotwell level</a>.</p>
          <p>The <a class="y">automatic hotwell control</a> can be used to prevent the hotwell tanks from getting overfilled, and the level can be set via the keypad. For efficiency and a hotter water temperature, higher levels are generally better.</p>
          <p>If the hotwell tank gets too full, the hotwell drains can be used (located on in the ECCS section, to be added).</p>
          <p>During emergencies when water is lost from the system or the reactor needs to be cooled while it is offline, the plants service/makeup water system comes into play, the <a class="o">Pure CND tanks</a> store water from the local Susitna river which first gets treated by service polishers, after that the water can be used to make up water in both hotwells and the ECCS water tank for emergencies.</p>
          <p>The <a class="gr">service pump</a> provides cool water from the river for <a class="gr">OCC pumps</a> and <a class="gr">cooling tower basins</a>, that's because the water cooling is not 100% effective, and it gets lost as water vapour which can be seen coming out of the cooling towers, to prevent the condenser coolant circuit from drying up slowly the service pump provides make up water into cooling tower basins.</p>
          <p>OCC pumps, pump water provided by service pump into the heat exchanger to cool down the reactors primaly circuit when the reactor is offline, the now heated up water gets sent into a temporary basin to be cooled down, the water then gets sent back into the Susitna river. </p>
          <p>The <a class="o">make-up pump </a> transfers water from the CND tanks into hotwells A, B and ECCS water tank, in order to refill those you need to also open the <a class="o">feed valves</a>, 1 for eccs, and 2 for each hotwell.</p>
          <p>The <a class="r">emergency pure cnd</a> and <a class="r">pure cnd-service</a> are used in case of emergency's, emergency pure cnd allows you to use the emergency CND tanks 5-6 if you quickly need water into hotwell or ECCS, pure cnd service can use battery power to power itself in case if you lose offsite power, the pump acts as service pump providing water to OCC pumps and cooling tower basins at a cost of also using the CND tanks water supply instead of taking water from the river.</p>

      <h2>Deaerator</h2>

        <div>
          <p>The deaerator's true purpose is to remove impurities from the feedwater, using steam in order to heat the water up. This power plant features 2 deaerators, and similarly to the condenser coolant, has 2 loops (<a class="r">loop A</a> and <a class="y">loop B</a>), receiving steam from their respective steam drums, and water from the condensers.</p>
          <p>The deaerator has 2 valves, those being the <a class="g">steam input</a> and <a class="b">relief</a>. The steam input lets more steam in, raising the temperature, and increasing the pressure slightly, while the relief vents steam out, lowering the pressure.</p>
          <p>The <a class="gy">A-B Bleed valve</a> mixes the water of the 2 deaerators, helping the water level equal out on both deaerators.</p>
          <p>For proper deaeration (water cleaning), it needs to be configured at 250C and 100PSI. This can be done by using the <a class="o">automatic control</a></p>
          <p>The water level of the deaerator is mainly managed on the condensate panel; however, this panel features the <a class="o">overflow valve</a>, which prevents flooding of the deaerators.</p>

        <img src="images/Feedwater_Panel.webp" alt="Rod Control Panel" class="enlargeable"/>
        <div>
        <p>The <a class="g">Feedwater</a> controls how much enters the RPV (soon to be steam drums); The water level can be checked on the rod control panel. The pumps take water from the deaerator; If the deaerator level is too low, the pumps will start to cavitate and eventually trip. An insufficient number of them will cause the water level to drop, which can cause the reactor to scram.</p>
        <p>The <a class="o">feed limiter valve</a> is similar to the overflow valve; it prevents water from flooding the reactor pressure vessel. Turning the switch on will make it automatic by limiting the feedwater intake upwards of 50% to keep the water level; however, it can also be used in manual mode, via the keypad (with the switch off).</p>
        <p>The <a class="gr">isolation valves</a> prevent feedwater from entering and steam from exiting the <a class="gr">steam drums</a>. A closed <a class="gr">isolation valve</a> will cause the feedwater pumps to trip if they are already on or turned on.</p>

        <div>
        <p>The reactors <a class="g">main circulation pumps (MCPs)</a> take water from the reactor and run it back through the steam drums; Two loops (<a class="r">Loop A</a> and <a class="y">Loop B</a>) for their respective steam drums. Their main function in-game is trading heat for steam for the turbines.</p>
        <p>The heat of the reactor fuel can be seen on the <a class="b">heat distribution display</a>. A reactor that is too cold won't boil steam and might flood the reactor; meanwhile, a reactor that is too hot has a higher risk of fuel channel leaks. It is recommended to find the sweet spot for the best efficiency.</p>
        <p>(generally between 900 and 1200°F)</p>
        <p>Each loop has their own <a class="dg">heat exchanger valve</a>, when the valves are open the water that exited main circulation pumps gets redirected to the <a class="dg">heat exhanger</a> to cool down by exchanging heat with water from OCC pumps, this allows to cool the reactor while its offline due to it still heating up even after shutting down.
        <p>Additionally, loop A mainly circulates the water through reactors sectors (see on heat distibution panel) <a class="r">C and D</a>, while loop B through sectors <a class="y">A and B</a>, also, the<a class="gr">isolation valve switches</a> can be seen.</p>

      <h2>The Electrical Panel</h2>
      <div class="location-content";>

        <div>
          <p>
            The electrical panel is used to control the flow of electricity throughout the facility and offsite (aka. the grid). <br>
            <br>
            The <a class="o">64A-G2</a> breaker (Startup transformer) is used to power Bus A (orange line) during the reactor's off-time and start-up. Bus A contains all the pumps that can be powered by the startup transformer, with the rest being hosted in Bus B (blue line), which cannot be powered by the startup transformer.<br>
            <br>
            Breakers <a class="o">64A-M</a> and <a class="db">64B-M</a> have the functionality of moving power from the <a class="gy">turbine generators</a> to the 2 buses. After the run-up of turbine A, both of these breakers should be closed, assuming the turbine is producing enough excess power to provide for them. <a class="r">18M-G1</a> (The Main transformer) connects the turbine generators to offsite (black), allowing them to provide power to the grid.<br>
            <br>
            In the event that the turbines are unable to power the buses, for example, due to a trip, the <a class="y">automatic G1 offload</a> (if primed and active), will close the breaker to the startup transformer, providing power to bus A.<br>
            <br>
            The Low Voltage line (green), powered by either the <a class="dg">480LV-A</a> (turbines, startup transformer) or the diesel generators, hosts the lights, AC-DC converter and the battery charger, which are connected to several critical systems (crimson). Turning off the AC-DC breaker will cause the power from the low voltage line to flow directly through the battery, making it unable to charge.<br>
            <br>
            You may have noticed that the 480LV-A breaker goes both ways, that is because diesel generators can actually back-feed into Bus A. This requires both diesel generators to be active and Bus A to be unpowered. The diesel generators provide less power than the startup transformer and should only be used in emergencies.<br>
